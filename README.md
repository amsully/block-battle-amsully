## NOTE ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

My submitted blocks are located in the .tar.gz files! 
The code that makes up the current gitlab repo is for my next bot that will
perform much stronger than the zipped files.

### Also
 the PythonBot folder contains all my bots I coded in python (best fit strategy is currently implemented but you can see the other code as well in the tar.gz files.
